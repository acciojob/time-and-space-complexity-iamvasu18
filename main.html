	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the time taken to run the program/ function in very efficient manner.</p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm depends on the amount of space it takes to run the program. The best space complexity is O(n).</p>
